 - Wei Ho's talk:
          Speaker:  Wei Ho of Columbia University
          Location: January 10, 2014 at 2:30pm (MGH 231)
          Title:    Arithmetic invariant theory and applications
          Abstract: The origins of "arithmetic invariant theory" come from the work of Gauss, who used integer binary quadratic forms to study ideal class groups of quadratic fields. The underlying philosophy---parametrizing arithmetic and geometric objects by orbits of group representations---has now been used to study higher degree number fields, curves, and higher-dimensional varieties. We will discuss some of these constructions and highlight the applications to topics such as bounding ranks of elliptic curves and dynamics on K3 surfaces.
          This talk is intended for a general mathematical audience.

# Jan 8

 - hand out syllabus printout
 - status reports: name, what you've done related to the class so far
 - brainstorm about legit issues with this room:
     - foreign language class next door
     - strong perfume small
     - no computer stand, so I have to hunch
     - hot
 - go over syllabus
 - prime numbers


# Jan 6

 - Simon Spicer led class.  Proved that integers factor *uniquely* as a product of primes.
 - Introduced SageMathCloud briefly.
