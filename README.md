# Math 480 - Winter 2014 - Elementary Number Theory

- Professor: William Stein
- Location:  MWF at 11:30 in Condon Hall


# Textbook

- "Elementary Number Theory", William Stein, pub. with Springer-Verlag
- The book free available at http://wstein.org/ent
- If you buy the book, tell me, so I can donate the proceeds (according to state law)

# Course grade

- Your grade will be entirely determined by weekly assignments as follows:
    [Insert grading scale here]
- Homework will be assigned Wednesday and due the following Wednesday at midnight.
- Project: you will create a "research project" as part of this course.
   - You will submit something related to the project with every single homework assignment (so your project grade is integrated with the homework).
   - By the end of course, you will have a finished project, written using LaTeX.

# SageMathCloud

- Create a SageMathCloud project for this course, with me as a collaborator.
- I will also add everybody as collaborators on a single shared project.
- There will be a folder called homework with subdirectories.
     due-01-10
     due-01-17
     due-01-24
     ...
     due-03-14

- You will write up your homework solutions by editing a document in each folder.  At the moment it is due (midnight on the given day), I will automatically collect all the homeworks.  I will then grade them and the graded version will appear next to your submission in the same directory.
- I may use some amount of peer grading (if you find this unacceptable, drop the class now).
- The lowest 2 grades are dropped.  Absolutely no late homework will be accepted.
- NOTE: SageMathCloud is a major new website that I created basically from scratch in the last year.  It is still buggy, so be sure to let me know of any issues.
- You can use git to obtain and update a complete copy of all lecture notes, etc., for this class.  Do this in a terminal:

        # Do this once the first time to get a complete copy.
        cd ~; git clone https://github.com/williamstein/480-ent-2014

        # Do this any time to update your copy.
        cd ~/480-ent-2014; git pull


# Office Hour

- Tuesdays in Padelford C423 1-2pm
- Just talk to me after class if possible, since I have nothing scheduled right afterwards.

# Content

## Book

- We will go through much of the textbook, which is about number theory. Book is based on a course I taught a few times at Harvard, UCSD, and here at UW.

## Main Topics

This is what you will learn in this class.

### Math

 - Prime numbers
 - Integers modulo n
 - Continued fractions
 - Public key cryptography
 - Elliptic curves

### Computing

 - LaTeX
 - Sage (Python)
