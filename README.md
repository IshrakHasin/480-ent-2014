# Math 480 - Winter 2014 - Elementary Number Theory

- Professor: William Stein
- Location:  MWF 12:30-1:20 in Condon Hall (CDH) room 223B
- Website: <https://github.com/williamstein/480-ent-2014>

# Textbook

- "Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences, and Secrets", William Stein, pub. with Springer-Verlag
- The book free available at the course website as book.pdf.
- If you buy the book, tell me, so I can donate the proceeds (according to state law)

# Course grade

- Your grade will be entirely determined by weekly assignments as follows:
    [Insert grading scale here]
- Homework will be assigned Wednesday and will be due the following Wednesday at midnight.
- Project: you will write a paper as part of this course.
   - You will submit an updated to your paper with each homework assignment (so your paper grade is completely integrated with the homework grade).
   - By the end of course, you will have a finished paper, written using LaTeX.

# SageMathCloud

- Create a SageMathCloud project for this course with title "480nt-Your Name", and add me as a collaborator (type "wstein@gmail.com" into the collaborators box).
- I will also add all students as collaborators on a big free-for-all shared project.
- I will add to your project a directory called "homework" with the following subdirectories:
     due-01-10
     due-01-17
     due-01-24
     ...
     due-03-14
- You will write up your homework solutions by editing documents in each folder.  At the moment it is due (midnight on the given day), I will automatically collect all the homeworks.  I will then grade them and the graded version will appear next to your submission in the same directory.
- I may use some amount of peer grading (if you find this unacceptable, drop the class now).
- The lowest 2 grades are dropped.  Absolutely no late homework will be accepted.
- NOTE: SageMathCloud is a major new website that I created basically from scratch in the last year.  It is still buggy, so be sure to let me know of any issues.
- You can use git to obtain and update a complete copy of all lecture notes, etc., for this class.  Do this in a terminal:

        # Do this once the first time to get a complete copy.
        cd ~; git clone https://github.com/williamstein/480-ent-2014

        # Do this any time to update your copy.
        cd ~/480-ent-2014; git pull


# Office Hours

- Tuesdays in Padelford C423 1-2pm
- Just talk to me after class if possible, since I usually have nothing scheduled right after class.
